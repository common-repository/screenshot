== Description ==

Screenshot is a plugin that will neatly take a screenshot of your blog entries and automatically show the screenshot on the home and search pages of your blog.

It works really simply, the plugin calls our WSCreative site and asks for a screenshot of your page. It really is that simple.

With the set up as it is, the screenshots will be stored on our server and updated on a regular basis. To see the plugin in action just check out our techblog www.wscreative.co.uk/blog/
